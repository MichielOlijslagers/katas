Greetings and salutations, welcome to Evil Corp, where we specialize in providing top-of-the-line evil-tech to all the villains and dictators out there. We're thrilled to have you on board as our newest developer for the censoring unit.

Our latest venture involves a trial run of one of our previous products, but with a twist: we'll be delivering it in stages. This approach allows us to employ the Agile Methodology, enabling us to dish out evil as soon as possible and adapt as we go along, ensuring the most valuable kind of evil is delivered.

For the initial phase, our objective is to develop a system that can censor specific words in text. For example, if the term "nice" is designated as a prohibited term, our clients will expect an input text such as "You are a nice person" to be transformed into "You are a XXXX person".
