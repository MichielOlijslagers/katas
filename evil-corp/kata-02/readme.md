The initial delivery was successful, and the owner is expected to arrive later today. In the afternoon, Mr. E.Vil entered the room and suggested that the system should now support blacklisting multiple words, as the list of such words could be quite extensive.

As an example, if words like "nice," "pony," "sun," "light," "fun," "happy," "funny," and "joy," among others, are blacklisted, the sentence "Such a nice day with a bright sun, makes me happy" would be transformed into "Such a XXXX day with a bright XXX, makes me XXXXX".
